# Intro to data science group activities for midterms

Sup nerds!

This is a repo for our upcoming group activities which are the midterm act 1 and the group case-study.

These are the following tasks that we need to do:

For the Midterm Act 1:

1. Choose a dataset related to a real-world problem (e.g., COVID-19 cases, stock market trends, population growth).
2. Use Excel, Google Sheets, or Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) to create:
   - A bar chart for categorical data
   - A line chart for time-series data
   - A scatter plot for numerical relationships
3. Analyze the chart and answer:
   - What patterns or trends can be observed?
   - How does the visualization help in understanding the data?
4. Present the findings to the class.

Tech/Libraries we can use for this activity:

- Excel: pls help me on this me not good at this HAHAHAHA bruh L pivot tables
- Python + Libraries pip install the following:

  - plotly.express  //this is for the data visualization or the graphs(I just like this for the interactivity HAHHASDHASHD bruh)
  - matplotlib //another data visualization tool for the bare minimum
  - pandas //so we can do data cleaning and data analysis on the dataframesss yeheeeey L dolores for not teaching us the fundamentals of data analysis
  - numpy
  - ipykernel   //this is used so that you guys can use jupyter notebooks or the python files with the .ipynb extension
  - just make a **.venv** which is the **python virtual environment**  then use the command **pip install -r requirements.txt** to install everything that I mentioned here

For the group case-study:
Objective: Develop a data visualization dashboard using a dataset of your choice.

Instructions:

1. Select a Dataset: Choose a dataset related to finance, healthcare, education, or any other relevant field.
2. Create at Least Three Visualizations:

   - One categorical visualization (bar/pie chart)
   - One numerical visualization (scatter plot/histogram)
   - One time-series visualization (line/area chart)
3. Tool: Use Excel, Power BI, Tableau, or Python.
4. Interpretation: Write a short report explaining:

   - The dataset and its source
   - Insights drawn from the visualizations
   - How the visualizations improve data understanding
5. Submission Format: Submit a PowerPoint or PDF report containing visualizations and analysis.

Rubric:

- Data Selection & Relevance (10 points)
- Visualization Clarity & Accuracy (15 points)
- Analysis & Insights (15 points)
- Presentation & Organization (10 points)
- Total: 50 points

For this L activity we can use the following techs:

- Excel: we can make basic dashboards dito pero pahirapan bruh L
- Tableau: another good dashboarding tool
- Power BI: tableau but microsoft bruh
- Python + libraries same libraries as the first act but to make a good dashboard we need to pip install this:
  - pip install dash  // this is from the same peeps who made plotly they are good af

# ADDITIONAL NOTES/THINGS:

- I'll put an ipynb file where I partially cleaned the summarized csv file which I will export as a diff file name so you guys can use it
- The dataset we'll use will be from  records dating from 2020-2-15 until 2022-05-14
- I'll put 3 datasets here which will consist of the ff.:
  - Covid Daily Data
  - Covid Summary Data
  - Covid Summary Data 2(Slightly Cleaned) - This is where I replaced null values with 0 instead so we can easily analyze it without errors saying that the data columns have null values bruh. The filename for this is yung summary_data2.xlsx
